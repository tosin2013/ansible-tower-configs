= This will define the sets used to get a successful OpenShift deployment.

== Pre Defined workflows
These are the following workflow steps in my lab running vmware. You may have to edit the workflow steps or the playbooks in your own environment.

**Before starting the work flows make sure the credentials are configured in your tower instance. Any successfully synced with your target inventory.**
=== Manual deployment
* WF - Deploy DNS Server
* Configure DNS server for OpenShift <-> Against dnsserver
* WF - Deploy OpenShift Jumpbox
* Configure Tower For OpenShift Deployments <-> Against Tower
* login to deployed Openshift jumpbox
* update all credentials on ansible tower.
* You may have to rerun the Configure Tower For OpenShift Deployments to correctly configure the environment.
* Test the vmware environment
* WF - Deploy OpenShift Master Node
* WF - Deploy OpenShift Worker Nodes
* CONFIGURE A DNS WILDCARD
* OpenShift Preinstallation Checks <-> Against dnsserver
* OpenShift Preinstallation Checks <-> Against master node and workers
* OpenShift Prerequisites <-> Openshift inventory example: OSE_3.11
* Deploy OpenShift Cluster

=== End to end Deployment
* WF - Deploy DNS Server
* Configure DNS server for OpenShift <-> Against dnsserver
* WF - Deploy OpenShift Bastion
* login to deployed OpenShift Bastion
* Update License
* Configure Tower For OpenShift Deployments <-> Against Tower
* update all credentials on ansible tower.
* You may have to rerun the Configure Tower For OpenShift Deployments to correctly configure the environment.
* Test the vmware environment
* WF - End to End OpenShift Deployment - Minimal Example or WF - End to End OpenShift Deployment - CNS Example

== Testing before Deployment
* Deploy  Virtual Machine on VMWARE
* Wipe vmware vm

=== uninstall OpenShift
* OpenShift Uninstall

=== Clean up Deployment remove vms
* WF - Wipe OpenShift Deployment - Minimal Example or WF - Wipe OpenShift Deployment - CNS Example

=== manually wipe VM
